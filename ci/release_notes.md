# Major Release

* This release brings `cf-genesis-kit` up to date with the releases found in
  `cf-deployment` v12.25.0.

# New Features

* Log Throttling: by specifying `params.max_log_lines_per_second`, you can
  limit the maximum log lines per second per app instance.  A value of 0
  disables this limit (which is the default state).

  Note: This is an _EXPERIMENTAL_ feature, and as such, should not be used in
  a production environment without full understanding of its implications.
