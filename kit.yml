  This kit will deploy OSS Cloud Foundry to BOSH. It contains
  subkits to help identify where your databases and blobstore are,
  customizations for Azure environments, and to enable an appropriate
  HA Proxy configuration if desired. It is loosely based off of the
  [cf-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment) repo.

subkits:
  # Needs to go first so that it blobstore job is deleted properly
  # FIXME:  fix things so this is not merge-order-dependent
  - prompt: Are you deploying Cloud Foundry on Azure?
    subkit: azure
    default: no

  - prompt: What database backend will you use for internal CF databases? (uaadb, ccdb, diegodb, routingdb, network_policy_db, network_connectivity_db)?
    type: database backend
    choices:
      - subkit: db-external-mysql
        label: An MySQL databases deployed externally to Cloud Foundry (e.g. RDS)
      - subkit: db-external-postgres
        label: A Postgres databases deployed externally to Cloud Foundry (e.g. RDS)
      - subkit: db-internal-mysql
        label: I do not have external databases for Cloud Foundry. I would like a 3-node MySQL+Galera cluster
      - subkit: db-internal-postgres
        label: I do not have external databases to offer Cloud Foundry. Please give me a single-point-of-failure Postgres

  - prompt: What blobstore backend will you use for CloudFoundry?
    type: blobstore backend
    choices:
      - subkit: blobstore-s3
        label: Amazon S3
      - subkit: blobstore-azure
        label: Azure Blobstore
      - subkit: blobstore-gcp
        label: Google Cloud Platform Blobstore
      - subkit: blobstore-webdav
        label: A single-point-of-failure WebDAV server deployed alongside CF via BOSH

  - prompt: |
      Do you need to include an HA Proxy configuration in front of Cloud Foundry?
      Common reasons for doing so include:

      - Deploying to an IaaS that does not provide a built-in load-balancing option,
        and not having hardware load balancers to use
      - You have multiple app domains pointing to Cloud Foundry, and each require
        unique SSL certificates, and your IaaS load balancer doesn't support SNI
      - You have domains hosted in Cloud Foundry that should be restricted to
        internal-only traffic
    type: haproxy backend
    choices:
      - subkit: haproxy-notls
        label: I need HA Proxy installed with Cloud Foundry, but will terminate SSL connections before they are sent to HA Proxy
      - subkit: haproxy-tls
        label: I need HA Proxy installed with Cloud Foundry, and HA Proxy will terminate SSL
      - subkit: omit-haproxy
        label: I will be using IaaS-provided load balancer doing SSL termination

  - prompt: Do you want to enable TCP Routing support for Cloud Foundry?
    subkit: tcp-routing

  - prompt: Do you want to enable NFS Volume Services in your Cloud Foundry?
    subkit: nfs-volume-services

  - prompt: Do you want to install the SHIELD agent to backup your database/blobstore if applicable?
    subkit: shield

  - prompt: "Do you want to deploy Cloud Foundry with a reduced VM footprint (but still HA capable)?"
    subkit: small-footprint

  - prompt: "Do you want to shrink your CF to single-nodes of each job for a smaller testing/dev footprint?"
    type: HA-i-ness
    choices:
    - subkit: minimum-vms
      label: "Yes, I want only one of each VM type, and **NO** HA to save on costs in a development environment"
    - subkit: ~
      label: "No, I need high availability!"

        This is used to autocalculate many domain-based values of your Cloud Foundry.
        Changing it will have widespread changes throughout the installation. If you change

        the shared domains.

        To ensure that CF apps have access to talk to their services, we've added a default

        Try `dig @8.8.8.8 +short myapp.<domain>` for each of your CF domains to get a full

        The `internal_only_domains` are used to tell HA Proxy what domains to refuse requests for
        unless the requests originate from addresses in the `trusted_domain_cidrs`. This is
        useful for hiding private domains that only your apps should be able to see. Consider
        using this even if the domain is not publicly resolvable, as HTTP Host header spoofing
        could otherwise be used to access the private apps.
    - param: trusted_domain_cidrs
      description: |
        The `trusted_domain_cidrs` are used to whitelist traffic destined for domains in the list
        of `internal_only_domains`. If a request goes to an internal only domain, and isn't
        from the trusted CIDRs, it is blocked. This should be specified as a space-separated list.

        This is usually something like `secret/path/to/keys/for/shield/agent:public`
        If you are unsure, use `safe tree` to find it.
